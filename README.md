# Service-worker-notification
Small project to demonstrate the very basics of using the Push API to display a notification on the user's device. 

## Usage
- To run the server, inside the server folder, first run `npm install` to install the dependencies and then run `node app.js`. 
- This will host the server on `localhost:3001`.
- To run the client, use a live server extension and run it on a different port.
